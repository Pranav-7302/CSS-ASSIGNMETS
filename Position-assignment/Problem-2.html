    <h1>Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative Positioning.</h1>  
    <h3>Absolute and relative positioning are two CSS positioning properties used to control the placement of elements on a web page. They are part of the CSS box model, which defines how elements are rendered and positioned within the document, </h3>

    <dl>
        <dt>Absolute Positioning:</dt>
        <dd>Absolute positioning allows you to position an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, such as an element with a position property set to relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky.
            When you apply absolute positioning to an element, you can use properties like top, right, bottom, and left to specify the exact position of the element in relation to its nearest positioned ancestor.
            The element is removed from the normal flow of the document, which means it does not affect the positioning of other elements. Other elements will be positioned as if the absolutely positioned element doesn't exist.
            Absolute positioning is often used for creating overlays, pop-up windows, or elements that need to be precisely positioned on the page.</dd>

            <dt>Relative Positioning:</dt>
            <dd>Relative positioning allows you to position an element relative to its normal position in the document flow. It does not remove the element from the document flow like absolute positioning does.
                When you apply relative positioning to an element, you can use properties like top, right, bottom, and left to offset the element from its normal position.
                The element still occupies space in the document flow, and other elements will be positioned as if the relative positioning adjustments have been applied.
                Relative positioning is often used for fine-tuning the position of elements without taking them out of the document flow.
                Example of relative positioning:</dd>

    <h4>In summary, the key difference between absolute and relative positioning is that absolute positioning allows you to position an element relative to a positioned ancestor and removes the element from the document flow, while relative positioning allows you to position an element relative to its normal position in the document flow without removing it from the flow. Both positioning techniques have their uses in web design, and the choice between them depends on the specific layout and design requirements of a web page.</h4>
